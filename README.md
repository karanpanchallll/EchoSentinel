EchoSentinel
EchoSentinel is a modern web application that performs real-time sentiment analysis and profanity detection on audio content. Upload audio files (WAV, MP3) and visualize sentiment patterns and inappropriate language through an intuitive, interactive dashboard.
üåü Features

Real-time Analysis: Watch as your audio is processed sentence by sentence
Dual Metrics: Track both overall sentiment scores and profanity detection simultaneously
Visual Indicators: Color-coded visualization with clear highlighting of concerning content
Interactive Graph: Hover for detailed information about specific sentences
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
üöÄ Installation
Prerequisites

Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
Python (v3.8 or higher)
FastAPI
React.js

Frontend Setup
bashCopy# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echo-sentinel.git
cd echo-sentinel/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
Backend Setup
bashCopy# Navigate to the backend directory
cd ../backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

üîß Configuration
The application uses a WebSocket connection to communicate between the frontend and backend. The default WebSocket URL is ws://localhost:8000/ws-graph.
To change this configuration, modify the following files:

Frontend: src/SentimentAnalysisGraph.js
Backend: nlp_trial.py

üìä How It Works

Upload Audio: Submit WAV or MP3 files through the interface
Audio Processing: The backend transcribes the audio to text
Sentiment Analysis: Each sentence is analyzed for sentiment score (-1 to 1)
Profanity Detection: Text is analyzed using a custom LSTM model to detect inappropriate language
Visualization: Results are displayed in real-time on an interactive graph
Highlighting: Negative sentiment and profanity are automatically highlighted
